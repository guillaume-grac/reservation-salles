# reservation-salles
My fourth project in php, after 2 month of php. 

This project consisted in creating a room reservation site.

This time I used poo and pdo. I'm also starting to look at the MVC model.

I was inspired by a room to rent underwater in the bahamas.

(Please forgive my bad english)

Guillaume.
